#Data Science Portfolio

PORTFOLIO 1:

For portfolio-1 we are given a cycle rides dataset and the health dataset from Strava corresponding to these rides. We are going to merge these two datasets and try extropolate key realtionships between peoples rides and the fitness features present in the Strava dataset. Further on we are going to diffrentiate the rides into three categories- 'Race', 'Workout' & 'Rides', and explore what makes these categories different from each other. Finally from the weather dataset we have gathered we explore the effect of Temprature on people's rides routine.





PORTFOLIO 2:

For portfolio-2 we are given dataset which covers the appliance usage of households over a period of time. In this work we try to explore greater visuals which give deeper insights into household energy consumption routines. We try to answer questions such as: 


How does the energy consumption for an household look over a month?

How does the energy consumption for an household look over a weeks time?

Does energy consumption vary over the holidays?

What is correlation between energy usage of appliance's and the temprature they are present in?

After performing a in-depth visual analysis we move on to build a Logistic Regression model using our training dataset and predict the accuracy of the model using our test data set. We further go on to explore the performance of the model by adding categorical features into our model. Finally we use the RFE technique to extract the best features required to build our model and plot a graph to check how does the accuracy score differ based on how many features are selected.




PORTFOLIO 3:

For portfolio-3 we are given a dataset which contains book summaries and their respective genres. In this portfolio  we tried to check the performance of various machine learning models. Our main objective is to build a machine learning model to predict the genres accurately based on key words noticed in the summaries of a book. We deploy various machine learning models to do the same:

- Logisitic Regression
- Decision Tree
- Naive Bayes
- SVM
- K nearest neighbors
- Neural Networks
- Adaboost classifier
- Random Forest 

Once we get performance features of various models, we plot a graph to compare the performance of various models and comment on the performance of the models.
